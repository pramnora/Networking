## Networking computers

Networking, is a term which refers to the joining together of 2 or more computers so that they are inter-linked; and, therefore, can share data jointly with one another.

Computer networking, generally consists of two separate parts which is related to a mixture of both...
- Hardware
- Software

## The many different kinds of computers

It is, also, well worth bearing in mind that there are many different kinds of computers that are available to purchase, now-a-days, including...
- Supercomputers (which fill up a whole entire room)
- Desktop PC/Tower PC/Mini PC/PC on a stick
- Laptop
- Palmtop
- Single board computers: Raspberry Pi/...
- Tablet computer: iPad/...
- Mobile phones: iPhone/...
- Computer inside of a watch: Apple Watch/...
- Game computers: XBox/...
- Internet connected TV's
- etc.
...this means that some computers are 'wired'/and, others are, in fact, 'wireless'.

Each of these computing devices has it's own uniquely identifying MAC address...; to which can be assigned a unique IP address(IPv4: dotted quad: nnn:nnn:nnn:nnn). 

The IP address can be assigned either 'statically'/or else, 'dynamically, instead. This means, the device MAC address doesn't ever change/but, the device IP address can change.

## The pros and cons of Networking...

Networking computers together can be very helpful, indeed...; for example, the internet can be regarded as being the biggest library in the whole wide world.

But, on the other hand, networking also comes with lots of 'invisible' dangers...; namely, it's possible for potential thieves to steal information...such as your private data: ID/or, credit cards; as well as, use the internet to utterly malevolently 'spy' on other people, and, into their daily activities, as well. Therefore, it's best to be very careful what sort of data you choose to put up as being quite freely available all over the internet; you don't know who's choosing to look at it...they could be either good/bad intentioned people. 

This situation is, in fact, further complicated...in that we don't always quite deliberately choose to share our data with others through our own local computer; many businesses/or, government related departments do save our data on their supposedly 'protected' computers...which certain extremely 'skillful' hackers can get into anyway. So, the truth is, as long as your data is being stored inside of a computer; then, it is no longer safe.
